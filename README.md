AppKeys Gnome Shell Extension
=============================

Adds Super+NUM shortcuts for activating applications from dash. No configurations necessary.
Forked from https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/413/dash-hotkeys/

Tested with 3.4 and 3.6 (3.5 should also work).

*Unfortunately it is not working with current Gnome Shell version 3.8*
